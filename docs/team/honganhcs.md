### Project: camNUS

camNUS is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage assessments and class participation among students based on their contacts. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * Adding assessments
  * Deleting assessments
  * Grading students

* **Code contributed**:
  * Added Assessment, Tutorial and Student related classes to the model
  * Added support for saving student results in tutorials to the storage
